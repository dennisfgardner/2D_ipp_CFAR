# Two-Dimensional (2D) Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP) Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) Detector

Using's Intel's Integrated Performance Primitives we make a two-dimensional Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detector.
This is code is useful when detecting relatively bright and small objects in a image.
For example, if you wanted to detect the locations of stars in an image, but that image had a non-uniform background so a simple threshold hold will not work.
